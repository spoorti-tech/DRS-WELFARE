          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS SELF SUPPORT SCHEME (drswelfareindia) was established for HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS and by
            HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS to support them. drswelfareindia is managed by the HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TRUST.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Main Rules (For Members)</h2>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-700 mb-6">
            <li>
              To join drswelfareindia, Doctors and Dentists may voluntarily register through the website after agreeing to these terms
              and conditions. A yearly membership fee is charged for joining the scheme.
            </li>

            <li>
              Maximum age to join drswelfareindia is 60 years. Applicants older than 60 will not be accepted for new membership.
              There is a waiting (lock-in) period of 1 year from the date of registration during which certain benefits
              may not be available. Coverage (where applicable) can be provided up to the age of 75 years according to
              the scheme rules and eligibility at the time.
            </li>

            <li>
              Registration is mandatory and must be completed by filling out the required information form. drswelfareindia will
              also share essential information via social media platforms, the app and the website. drswelfareindia follows the rule:
              only those who cooperate will receive support — members are expected to send support to the families of deceased
              members when called upon.
            </li>

            <li>
              The lock-in period for all members is 12 months (1 year). Support will not be provided if a nominee is found to
              be involved in suicide or murder; in special circumstances the final decision rests with drswelfareindia. Rules will be
              available on the website (current rules and previous versions where applicable).
            </li>

            <li>
              drswelfareindia may exercise discretion in decisions regarding calls for contributions, including conducting due diligence
              on legality or other matters as appropriate. Members and nominees do not have a legal claim to receive
              contributions; drswelfareindia will ethically strive to secure contributions.
            </li>

            <li>
              If a Doctor mistakenly sends an excess amount to a nominee's account, the nominee must return the funds upon
              presentation of appropriate evidence. drswelfareindia will make reasonable efforts to assist but cannot guarantee
              recovery of mistakenly transferred funds.
            </li>

            <li>
              Making contributions is mandatory to be eligible to receive contributions. After becoming a member and
              completing contributions post lock-in period, members must upload receipts via the website or a provided form
              as required. Failure to contribute or to upload required receipts will render a member ineligible to receive
              contributions.
            </li>

            <li>
              Members who fail to cooperate may lose statutory membership status. Such members can reactivate status by
              contributing 100% of outstanding dues as defined by drswelfareindia.
            </li>

            <li>
              Members who leave the association may regain membership in the future after paying all due contributions and
              fees as required by drswelfareindia rules.
            </li>

            <li>
              In the event of the deaths of multiple members, assistance will be provided in order of death date. If two or
              more members die on the same date, priority will be given based on the percentage/average of assistance as
              determined by drswelfareindia. drswelfareindia may alter order in special circumstances (e.g., inability to conduct field
              inspection or technical limitations).
            </li>

            <li>
              In case of any dispute regarding a nominee, the State/Core Team will review and decide after due scrutiny.
            </li>

            <li>
              All official information will be posted on drswelfareindia's Telegram/WhatsApp group and the App; members who do not
              receive information through these channels remain responsible for obtaining it. Members can contact the
              helpline for queries.
            </li>

            <li>
              drswelfareindia may amend or change any rules at any time as required. The copy of the rules posted on the website at
              the time of a decision will be considered the authoritative version.
            </li>

            <li>
              Members make contributions directly to the nominee of the deceased member; no member or third party has the
              right to bring judicial claims for contributions. Contributions are voluntary and depend on the willingness of
              members to give; drswelfareindia is not liable if contributions are less than expected.
            </li>

            <li>
              drswelfareindia does not coerce any Doctor to become a member. Membership is voluntary and requires acceptance of
              these rules. Members may voluntarily dissociate at any time.
            </li>

            <li>
              Members who submit forged or falsified receipts or otherwise act contrary to the rules may be terminated and
              denied benefits; drswelfareindia is authorized to make decisions regarding such cases.
            </li>

            <li>
              drswelfareindia will use membership fees to support the operation and services of the scheme, including website and
              app development/operation, SMS services, office and technical support, on-site inspections, membership
              campaigns, and adoption of technology to ensure transparency and ease of process.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Members give contributions directly to nominees of deceased doctors; contributions do not create legal entitlements
            to receive equivalent support. drswelfareindia will make reasonable efforts to verify contributions and compliance, but
            cannot guarantee any specific outcome if members do not contribute.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            In case of any dispute or question regarding these terms, the version of the rules uploaded on the website will be
            the valid copy and drswelfareindia reserves the right to decide accordingly.
